Here are the stuff im not able to fix 



Sitemap -

1.need to add the links in the sitemap

 <!-- Home -->
        <a href="about.html" class="nav-link">
          <circle cx="500" cy="100" r="70" fill="#ff5722" />
          <text x="500" y="105" text-anchor="middle" fill="#fff">Home</text>
        </a>

about.html - needs to be replaced to original path and so on 

2.nesecarry styles must be added so that it is similar to the theme of the whole website
 Ex- blur....

3. Nav bars paths should be setted
Ex -  <li><a href="../main">Home</a></li>



Gallery - 

1.image path should be fixed according to the github images 

2.abrar talked about fixing about the iframe part ( when the windows theme is changed to  dark or light the color of 
iframe is changd accordingly) not sure how to do that tho

3. to make both galary and sitemap's (html , css , js ) separated 

index.html
style.css
script.js
