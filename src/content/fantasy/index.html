    <p class="description"><strong>Fantasy</strong> has been around since man stared at the stars and witnessed gods staring back.
       Since he witnessed mythical beasts living among the wilderness. It was the foundation many fairy tales and folklore built upon.
      From the great epics of Gilgamesh to likes of Narnia and Lord of the Rings. It has been accompaning mankind through his forlone journey.</p>
    <p class="description"><strong>Escapism</strong> is the human desire to leave the quite boring, repetitive living of modern life behind,
         and to find a meaning or a purpose for themself. Simply put, to go on an <strong>Adventure</strong>. And one of the most recent forms of art, movies,
        and cinemas have followed this tradition of sweetening up our life, with the savor of great works culminated by the most brilliant and imaginative minds.</p>
    <p class="description">Fantasy is the merciful gift of sweetened water given to mankind's workaholic, exhausted mind. A gift from mankind to itself. A testament
      of its <strong>Limitless Imagination</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Dragons!</h3>
        <p class="description">Dragons... the mythical flying reptiles with a sweet tooth for gold and princesses. Oh, and they can breathe fire too!
          Dragons have been part of almost all cultures around the world. Even though their, depiction may vary. Nevertheless, it is clear they were 
          an import part of cultures. Today, there are many movies using the mighty dragons as plot mechanics. And in almost all such cases, they
          instill a sense of awe within us.
        </p>
        <p class="description">Some famous movies that include very powerful looking dragons are, Game of Thrones (as shown in the picture), Merlin, and
          Narnia. All highly recommended Fantasy movies!</p>

        <h3>Magic!</h3>
        <p class="description">It would not be a fantasy movie without a little bit of magic. While providing itself as a plot mechanic that can explain away, 
          some plot holes in the story. It also is able to impress the viewer with beautiful spells casted by wizards as they battle. Or as they cast a rare, powerful
          spell that makes the hair on your hands stand on their ends. Magic is always received warmly by those who enjoy fantasy movies. And even more so, its the very
          reason they would be watching such a movie!
        </p>
        <p class="description">Although magic is one way or another, part of almost all fantasy themed movies, some great recommendations include, Harry Potter (depicted on left),
           Alice in Wonderland and, Wizards of Oz.

        <h3>Elves!</h3>
        <p class="description">The fairest of all living beings, the most gentle, elegant and nature loving mythical race of Elves, is another aspect of fantasy that
          immediately comes to mind, at the mention of the genre. One of the most prominent traits of Elves is their mysterious nature. As beings that mostly seem, the same as 
          normal humans, yet practices entirely different customs, different cultures, viewers can be enchanted by the depiction of elves in movies today.
        </p>
        <p class="description">Lord of the Rings (shown on right), The Witcher, and the Spiderwick Chronicles are all highly recommended movies starring these mysterious creatures.
